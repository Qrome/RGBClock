# RGB LED Clock

## Features:


## Required Parts:
* Wemos D1 Mini: https://amzn.to/2ImqD1n
* 12 RGB LED Ring 

Note: Using the links provided here help to support these types of projects. Thank you for the support.  

## Wiring for the Wemos D1 Mini to the RGB Ring
RBB Pin -> D3  
5V Pin -> VCC
Ground -> Ground


## 3D Printed Case by Qrome:  

## Compiling and Loading to Wemos D1 Mini
It is recommended to use Arduino IDE.  You will need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the Wemos board and USB port and installed the required USB drivers etc.  
* USB CH340G drivers:  https://wiki.wemos.cc/downloads
* Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.  This will add support for the Wemos D1 Mini to Arduino IDE.
* Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after installation).
* Select Board:  "WeMos D1 R2 & mini"
* Set 1M SPIFFS -- this project uses SPIFFS for saving and reading configuration settings.

## Loading Supporting Library Files in Arduino
Use the Arduino guide for details on how to installing and manage libraries https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries  
**Packages** -- the following packages and libraries are used (download and install):  
WiFiManager.h --> https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager  
Adafruit_NeoPixel.h --> Library Manager

## Initial Configuration
All settings may be managed from the Web Interface, however, you may update the **Settings.h** file manually -- but it is not required.  There is also an option to display current weather when the print is off-line.  
NOTE: The settings in the Settings.h are the default settings for the first loading. After loading you will manage changes to the settings via the Web Interface. If you want to change settings again in the settings.h, you will need to erase the file system on the Wemos or use the “Reset Settings” option in the Web Interface.  

## Web Interface
This project uses the **WiFiManager** so when it can't find the last network it was connected to 
it will become a **AP Hotspot** -- connect to it with your phone and you can then enter your WiFi connection information.

After connected to your WiFi network it will display the IP addressed assigned to it and that can be 
used to open a browser to the Web Interface.  **Everything** can be configured there.
